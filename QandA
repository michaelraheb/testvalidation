1.) Local Changes
By rights, you should know if you've made local changes and not added them to your
repository. If you aren't sure, type "git status" and the shell will tell you what
you need to commit.
  a.) For committing: use "git add <file>"
                          "git commit -m "message""
                          "git push"

2.) Shared Changes
After a work session, you might have changes in your shared repository that are not
locally present. You can run "git remote update" to update the reference to your
remote (shared) repository; "git status" will then tell you whether your local branch
is behind the remote branch. Using "git show-branch *master" will tell you what,
exactly, has been updated in your remote repository (origin/master branch).
"git pull" to incorporate the changes. Before you pull, the files within your local
repository will not have yet changed.

3.) Conflict: Shared Repository vs. Uncommited Local Changes
