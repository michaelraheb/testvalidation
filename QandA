1.) Local Changes
By rights, you should know if you've made local changes and not added them to your
repository. If you aren't sure, type "git status" and the shell will tell you what
you need to commit.
  a.) For committing: use "git add <file>"
                          "git commit -m "message""
                          "git push"
